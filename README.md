# Nekobot
Version 1.0.0

Bot for Discord using the [Discord.Net](https://github.com/RogueException/Discord.Net) Library.

If you want to try running it as is, please rename the creds.example to creds and change the email
and password examples to your bot's account. I also recommend connecting by yourself to that account
beforehand and manually joining a server to be able to use the commands with the bot. (After all, a
bot which isn't in any server is pretty much useless.)

Server where the bot is being tested: https://discord.gg/0Lv5NLFEoz3P07Aq
