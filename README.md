# Nekobot
Version 1.0.0

Bot for Discord using the [Discord.Net](https://github.com/RogueException/Discord.Net) Library.

You'll need a "creds" file with no extension containing a email address for the Discord account on one line and a password on the next. I also recommend connecting by yourself to that account beforehand and manually joining a server to be able to use the commands with the bot. (After all, a bot which isn't in any server is pretty much useless.)

Server where the bot is being tested: https://discord.gg/0Lv5NLFEoz3P07Aq
