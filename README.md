# Nekobot
Version 2.0.0

Bot for Discord using the [Discord.Net](https://github.com/RogueException/Discord.Net) Library.

You'll need to make a config.json file in the same place as the executable using this template:

```javascript
{
	"email" : "myemail@example.com",
	"password" : "MySuperSecretPassword123",
	"prefix" : "!",
	"master" : "63296013791666176",
    "server" : "https://discord.gg/0Lv5NLFEoz3P07Aq",
    "musicFolder" : "",
    "pitur" : "",
    "gold" : "",
    "cosplay" : ""
}
```

The email and password lines are self explanatory.
The prefix needs to be one character long, and will be the character used in front of literally every command. 
If you put more than one characters in the prefix value field, only the first one will be used.
As for the master, it's value should be the 17-digits id of the Discord account that should be recognized as the master. (The master id gets a level 10 permission level, although no official commands are above level 3.)
The server line allows you to make the bot join a server on startup using that. The value can either be the full invite link as shown above, or only the characters at the end (ex.: the "0Lv5NLFEoz3P07Aq" part of "https://discord.gg/0Lv5NLFEoz3P07Aq".)
If the server line is empty, the bot will not join any channel, and to make it be of use, you'll have to manually connect into the bot's account and join a channel.
The musicFolder setting should be set to the full path to a folder containing a bunch of music files to be used for music streaming.
The pitur, gold and cosplay settings should be set to full paths to image folders containing whatever images you please. If they're not set, the commands will be disabled.

To add new commands to the bot, look at the GenerateCommands method's content in the Program.cs file, all the commands are being created in there at startup, therefore you should easily be able to add your own commands to it, by copying the way the official commands are made.

Also requires the [Discord.Net](https://github.com/RogueException/Discord.Net) github project to be added to the solution and referred to in the Nekobot project.
